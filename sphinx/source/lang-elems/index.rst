Language Elements
****************************************


The language elements are highly mutully recursive. E.g. definitions contain
expressions and expressions can contain local definitions. Therefore there is no
natural order to present the language elements and we present them in alphabetic
order.

However the most important language concepts are:

- :ref:`Projects`
- :ref:`Packages`
- :ref:`Modules`
- :ref:`Inductive Types`
- :ref:`Functions`
- :ref:`Pattern Match`
